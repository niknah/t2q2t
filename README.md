# t2q2t

t2q2t is a port forward tool that converts between TCP and QUIC. (TCP/QUIC Proxy).

You can benefit from QUIC with any application protocol using t2q2t.

usecase overview are below:

![t2q2t usecase](/img/overview.png)

- Client: listens on `0.0.0.0:2022` with TCP, and forwards to `192.168.0.1:22`(server ip) with QUIC
- Server: listen on `0.0.0.0:2022` with QUIC, and forward to `127.0.0.1:22` with TCP

```
# t2q2t <convert mode> <listen addr> <connect addr>

# on client side (TCP <-> QUIC)
$ ./t2q2t t2q 0.0.0.0:2022 192.168.0.1:2022

# on server side (QUIC <-> TCP)
$ ./t2q2t q2t 0.0.0.0:2022 127.0.0.1:22
```

## ssh

This is the same as the original t2q2t except that it has an s2q option so you can put it into .ssh/config like...

```
Host ServerWithQuic.com
	Port 2022
	ProxyCommand ~/Downloads/t2q2t/t2q2t s2q %h:%p
```


## build

```
$ git clone https://github.com/flano-yuki/t2q2t.git
$ cd ./t2q2t
$ CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 GO111MODULE=on go build t2q2t.go
$ go build ./t2q2t.go
``` 

You can also use the following Dockerfile to try it out in your Docker environmemnt.

```
# In the project root directory
$ docker build -t flano-yuki/t2q2t .
$ docker run -it -p 2022:2022 -p 2022:2022/udp --rm flano-yuki/t2q2t
tcp/quic port forward tool
  t2q2t <subcommand> <Listen Addr> <forward Addr>

  go run ./t2q2t.go t2q 0.0.0.0:2022 127.0.0.1:2022
  go run ./t2q2t.go q2t 0.0.0.0:2022 127.0.0.1:22
  go run ./t2q2t.go s2q 0.0.0.0:2022

Usage:
  t2q2t [command]

Available Commands:
  help        Help about any command
  q2t         Listen by quic, and forward to tcp
  t2q         Listen by tcp, and forward to quic
  s2q         Stream to quic
  version     Print the version number of t2q2t

Flags:
  -h, --help      help for t2q2t
  -v, --verbose   verbose output

Use "t2q2t [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```


## convert mode (sub command)

- `t2q`: Listen by TCP, and connect to QUIC
- `q2t`: Listen by QUIC, and connect to TCP
- `s2q`: Stream stdin/out to QUIC


## Note
This is a PoC.

t2q2t uses "t2q2t" as the ALPN identifier. It is not intended to communicate with other QUIC implementations.

TODO
- Improve error handling
- Improve connection management
- (Output connection statistics)
- Many other improvements
